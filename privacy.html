  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 10, 2025</p>

  <p>SpinShelf respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This policy explains what information is (and is not) collected by the app and how external services may handle your data.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    SpinShelf itself does not collect any personally identifiable information from users.
  </p>
  <p>
    The app may use local storage on your device to save your vinyl collection data. If you enable iCloud backup, your data may be securely stored in your private iCloud account under Apple’s terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you contact us via email or through the in-app support form, we may receive your email address and the message content solely to respond to your request.
  </p>

  <h2>Embedded Web Content</h2>
  <p>
    SpinShelf may display embedded websites, such as vinyl stores, using an in-app WebView. These third-party websites may collect personal information (e.g., name, email, payment details) for their own services and purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    SpinShelf does not have access to or store any of the data you provide to these third-party websites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those external sites before submitting your information.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    SpinShelf may integrate with services such as:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firebase</strong> – for optional features like sync and support</li>
      <li><strong>Discogs</strong> – for retrieving album information via barcode scan</li>
    </ul>
    These services have their own privacy policies and may collect data in accordance with their terms.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <p>
    You can choose not to use features like cloud backup or barcode scanning. You may also opt not to interact with any external websites within the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    To request deletion of any email-based support records, you may contact us at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:support@spinshelf.com">support@spinshelf.com</a>.</p>
