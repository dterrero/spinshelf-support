  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 8, 2025</p>

  <p>SpinShelf respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Some data may be used for tracking purposes to improve user experience and measure app performance, in compliance with applicable platform requirements.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    SpinShelf may use local storage on your device to save your vinyl collection data. If you choose to enable iCloud backup, your data may be securely stored in your private iCloud account.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you contact us via the in-app support feature or email, we may receive your email address and the content of your message to assist you.
  </p>

  <h2>Tracking & Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    SpinShelf may collect data through cookies and similar technologies when displaying embedded web content within the app. This data may be used for analytics, personalization, or other tracking purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    In compliance with Appleâ€™s AppTrackingTransparency framework, we will request your permission before tracking you across apps or websites owned by other companies. If you do not allow tracking, no tracking-related cookies will be used.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We use your data solely to provide and improve the SpinShelf experience. We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties without your consent.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    SpinShelf may integrate with services such as Firebase (for optional sync), Discogs (for album info via barcode scanning), and other tools that may use tracking technologies. These services have their own privacy policies, and their use of data is subject to their terms.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <p>
    You may choose not to use features like barcode scanning or cloud backup. You can also manage your tracking preferences through the app or device settings. You may contact us at any time to delete any email communication records.
